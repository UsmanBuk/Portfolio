# Premium Positioning Rules

Auto-apply these rules when creating or editing portfolio content.

## Target Rate: £1,600-£2,000/day

## 1. Specialist Positioning

### Identity Hierarchy
- **Primary**: "AI Systems Architect | Healthcare Technology"
- **Secondary**: "Enterprise RAG & LLM Specialist"
- **Tertiary**: "Cloud Architecture & MLOps"

### Avoid
- "Full Stack Engineer" or "Full Stack Developer"
- "Software Engineer" (too generic)
- "Web Developer"
- Any title without AI/ML qualifier

### Niche Formula
```
AI + Healthcare + Cloud Architecture = Rare, High-Value Combination
```

## 2. Business Value Translation

Never leave technical metrics without business context.

| Technical Metric | Business Translation |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| 40% downtime reduction | "£X annual cost avoidance" |
| 94% query success rate | "Reduced decision time from 12min to 30sec" |
| 20% infrastructure savings | "£X/year cost optimization" |
| 25% conversion increase | "£X additional annual revenue" |
| Automated pipeline | "X hours/week recovered for strategic work" |

**Always ask**: "What did this metric save or generate in £?"

## 3. Strategic Scope Signals

Include these signals in role descriptions:
- Team size led or mentored
- Budget owned or influenced
- Decision authority level
- C-level or stakeholder engagement
- Project complexity indicators

**Example**: "Led 5-person team, owned £500k cloud budget, reported to CTO"

## 4. Social Proof Priorities

Add in this order:
1. Client testimonials from decision-makers (CTOs, Directors)
2. Named client context (even anonymized: "Top 10 NHS Trust")
3. Quantified project scale (users, transactions, data volume)
4. Thought leadership (speaking, writing, open source)

## 5. Engagement Model Clarity

Contact section should include:
- Consultation-based entry point
- Clear engagement tiers (Full-time, Fractional, Advisory)
- Scarcity signal: "Currently accepting 1-2 new engagements"
- Response time commitment

## 6. Case Study Requirements

Every case study must include:
- [ ] Business problem (not just technical)
- [ ] ROI or cost savings calculation
- [ ] Client quote or testimonial
- [ ] Before/after metrics
- [ ] Complexity context (why was this hard?)
- [ ] Strategic decisions made (not just code written)

## 7. Differentiation Statement

Use and adapt:
> "The only engineer who has delivered production RAG systems across NHS with Azure AI, handling 3,000+ users with 94% success rate and zero security incidents."

## 8. Content Priorities

When updating portfolio:
1. Add testimonials/social proof first
2. Translate metrics to £ values
3. Add strategic scope to role descriptions
4. Enhance case studies with business outcomes
5. Update headline positioning last (after substance supports it)

## 9. Writing Style

- First person for achievements ("I architected..." not "The system was architected...")
- Active voice, action verbs
- Confident but not arrogant
- Specific numbers over vague claims
- Technical credibility with business awareness

## 10. Words to Use / Avoid

### Use
- Architected, Designed, Led, Delivered
- Production, Enterprise, Scale
- Measurable, Quantified, Proven
- Strategic, Advisory, Consulting

### Avoid
- Helped, Assisted, Supported (weak verbs)
- Various, Many, Multiple (vague quantities)
- Complex (say why it was complex)
- Expert (show, don't tell)
